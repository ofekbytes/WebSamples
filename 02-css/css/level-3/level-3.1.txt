-- Every element of the webpage is a box. 

-- CSS uses the box model to determine how big the boxes are and how to place them.

-!- The box model is also used to calculate the actual width and height of the HTML elements.


- Total Width of an Element:

-- When working with boxes, it is important to understand how the total width of an element is calculated. 

--- example: the total width of the box with paddings will be the sum of width plus padding left and padding right.
