- level 4.01 - The display Property
.

- display: block

-- Every element on a web page is a rectangular box.
   "display" property determines how that rectangular box behaves. 
   "block" element is an element that takes up the fullest width available, with line breaks before and after.


--- example: <span> elements as block-level elements:

    span 
    {
        display: block;
    }


--- example: <span> elements as block-level elements:
    <css-4.01.1.html>



- display: inline

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary, and does not force line breaks.

--- example: display: inline

    p 
    {
        display: inline;
    }


--- example: display: inline
    <css-4.01.2.html>

-!- Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, not what kind of element it is. 
    an inline element with display:block is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.



- display:none

-- display:none hides an element, so it does not take up any space. 
   The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there.

--- example: display: none

    h1 
    {
        display: none;
    }


--- example: display: none
    <css-4.01.3.html>

-!- There are display values, such as list-item, table, table-cell, table-column, grid, etc.
