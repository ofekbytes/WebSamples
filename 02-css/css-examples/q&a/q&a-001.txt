What is the difference between background and background color in CSS ? 

/* background */
body { background: blue; }

/* background-color */
body { background-color: blue; }

/**/
background-color
background-image
background-position
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-clip
background-origin
background-size

/**?????**/
<a>
Thus, 
besides the background-color, 
using the background shortcut you could also add one or more values 
without repeating any other  background-* property more than once.

Which one to choose is essentially up to you, 
but it could also depend on specific conditions of your style declarations 
(e.g if you need to override just the background-color 
when inheriting other related background-* properties from a parent element, 
or if you need to remove all the values except the background-color).

combine many background tags into one line. 
background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top; 
Combines color, image and background image properties in the one line 
instead of typing our each style individually.
