[CDN] - content delivery network -or- content distribution network.
CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers.
The goal is to distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability
and high performance.
- CDNs serve a large fraction of the Internet content today,
-- including web objects (text, graphics and scripts),
-- downloadable objects (media files, software, documents),
-- applications (e-commerce, portals),
-- live streaming media,
-- on-demand streaming media,
-- social networks.

- CDN nodes are usually deployed in multiple locations, often over multiple backbones.
- CDN Benefits include
-- reducing bandwidth costs,
-- improving page load times,
-- increasing global availability of content.

- The number of nodes and servers making up a CDN varies, depending on the architecture,
some reaching thousands of nodes with tens of thousands of
servers on many remote points of presence (PoPs).
Others build a global network and have a small number of geographical PoPs.

- CDN Benefit:
-- Cashing benefit
-- parallize benefit of browser can load different scripts from different domain (cross domain)
