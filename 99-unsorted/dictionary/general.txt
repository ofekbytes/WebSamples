**[Text Casing]**

*- PascalCase --> words first letter of each concatenated word is capitalized.
                  No other characters are used to separate the words, like hyphens or underscores.
                  Example: FirstName, LastName, BackColor, TextColor.

*-  camelCase --> wordsfirst letter can be lowercase or capitalized 
                  and each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized.
                  Example: firstName, lastName, backColor, textColor.

*-  Snake_case --> words always lowercased and combined with an underscore character (_)

*-  mIxEd CaSe --> words with uppercase and lowercase.



**[Variable Type convention]**

*- constant/case variable -  declare variable name with a UPPERCASE.

*- Class variable - declare variable name with PascalCase.

*- function / procedure - declare variable name with camelCase.

*- Single Letter Prefixes - declare a varaible word that his first 1-2 latter is small 
                            (type of variale) and the rest is PascalCase (the name/purpose of the variable).
                            sFirstName = "name"; //string
                            iMaxNumber = 10; //integer
                            stName = "name"; //String
