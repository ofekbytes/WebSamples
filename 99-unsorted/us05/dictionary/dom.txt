[DOM] - Document Object Model -
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent
application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or
XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.
The objects can be manipulated programmatically and any visible changes occurring as a result
may then be reflected in the display of the document.

The principal standardization of DOM was handled by the W3C, which last developed a recommendation in 2004.
WHATWG took over development of the standard, publishing it as a living document.
The W3C now publishes stable snapshots of the WHATWG standard.
